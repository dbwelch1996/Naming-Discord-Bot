This is a personal Discord bot that assigns nicknames to new members. It automatically appends a random adjective to a new member's nickname upon joining the server.

## Functionality

- Automatically changes new member nicknames to include a random adjective.
- Sources adjectives from a local text file (`english-adjectives.txt`).
